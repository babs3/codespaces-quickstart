Customer discovery
1.
State hypothesis
–
Draw Business Model
2.
Test the problem
–
Get out of the building
–
Test understanding of customer problem or need
3.
Test the solution
–
Build prototype
–
Test product-market fit
4.
Verify or pivot business model
20

Strategic Learning and Experimentation
Pivot
•
Pivots are possible results of hypothesis testing and experimentation
–
Hypothesis testing involves failure!
•
Pivot is a substantive change to one or more components of the 
business model
–
Iterations are minor changes
•
In a pivot, dismiss hypotheses that do not match reality
–
BUT, save the knowledge built!!!
21

Strategic Learning and Experimentation
Customer validation
1.
Get ready to sell
–
Acquire customer; Prepare distribution channels
–
Build Minimum Viable Product (MVP) – minimum features required to get
customers’ feedback (and then add more features)
2.
Get out of the building
–
“Test sell” to early evangelists
3.
Develop positioning
–
Corporate and product positioning
4.
Verify the business model (pivot or proceed)
–
Repeatable and scalable?

Strategic Learning and Experimentation

•
Company built on the ability to create innovation in a predictable
manner
Highlights:
•
Learn from failure
–
Disqualify failed experiments and continue search
–
“Fail often to succeed sooner”
–
Avoid mistakes! Mistakes produce no new/useful information (≠ failure)
•
Knowledge from failure or success can be stockpilled
–
Know what does not work is as important as knowing what does
–
Critical to keep track of failed hypothesis

• How do we change “guesses” into facts?
• The customer development process

Customer Segments
•
Job-to-be-done
–
What jobs are getting done?
–
What basic needs are you helping your customer satisfy?
–
What are (not) customer needs?
•
A customer need is a description of the benefits that customers want
•
It is different from a product feature: a description of how that need gets 
satisfied
•
To succeed at new product introduction, companies need to understand 
customer needs; many companies have failed because they did not 
understand their customers’ needs
–
What causes customers to buy a solution?
•
Customers have “jobs” that arise regularly and need to get done
•
They look for what they can hire to get the job done effectively, conveniently
and inexpensively
