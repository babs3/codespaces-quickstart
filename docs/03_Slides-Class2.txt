Sales Projections (Market model)
–
Bottom-up approach
Focus on individual sales first
1. Define fundamental unit of the business (what drives the business in the 
market?)
2. Consider sales cycle (time and cost of selling 1 unit)
3. Consider adoption curve (rate of adoption)
Focus on building/growing the business
4. Build the commercial effort (how many sales reps to hire)
5. Consider market development factors (external environment)
6. Consider product evolution (new releases in the future)
7. Consider other factors (seasonality, trends…)
