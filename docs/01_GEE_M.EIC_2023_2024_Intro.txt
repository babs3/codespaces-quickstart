to the problem at hand
19

Case study recommendations

business situations

other participants
20

Case study Report recommendations
- up to 20 slides
•
Take into account that the slide report will be used to assess your 
work and use the 20 slides limit.
•
Develop an appealing presentation, but also add relevant 
information to the report. One possible way to make this balance is 
to have more visual slides, and then add notes to the ppt file for 
more detail.
•
Use the concepts and tools from classes whenever relevant
•
Make your assumptions explicit
•
Support your statements with data, e.g. show tables and graphics 
that support your analysis and proposal. 
•
On the other hand, do not have tables without an explanation.
•
If you have to choose between alternatives, explore multiple ones, 
analyze pros and cons of each one, and support your decision
21

Case study discussion 
recommendations
•
Every group member must participate
•
Everyone needs to be aware and able to participate in the 
discussion of every question
•
Everyone needs to be able to explain how you reached the results in 
the spreadsheet
•
Remember quality of participation is more important than quantity
•
Do not read the slides, use them to support your argument
•
Do not make a sequence of presentations, engage in discussion
•
Do not repeat what others have said, build upon, for example 
summarizing what is similar to what the previous group said, and 
complement
•
This is not a zero sum game, you can all contribute to enrich the 
discussion and have a good grade
•
Learn and enjoy!

The importance of organizations
• Organization is a major force in society today: We are

entertain us and rules us. Finally we are buried by 
organizations called funeral homes.
Mintzberg, 1989

the best method of performing the task - Division
of Work
• Main goal : Improving efficiency and productivity
• Workers are a part of the machine and act 
rationally. 
• Management as Impersonal and Rational -
Bureaucratic Organizations
• Successful Employees - Rewarded
• Unsuccessful Employees - Terminated
46

Classical perspective
• Scientific Management (Frederick Taylor  -
1856-1915)
– Focusing on the management of work and workers.
• Administrative Management (Henry Fayol -
1841-1925)
– Addressing issues concerning how overall 
organization should be structured.
• Bureaucratic Management (Max Weber -
1864-1920)
– Looks at the organization as a rational entity, using 
impersonal rules and procedures to decision 
making.
47

Contingency theory
• States that there is no “one best way” to 
manage an organization.
– Because what works for one organization may 
not work for another
– Situational characteristics (contingencies) 
differ
– Managers need to understand the key 
contingencies that determine the most 
effective management practices in a given
situation
51

Learning Organization

– The management approach based on an 
organization anticipating change faster than 
its counterparts to have an advantage in the
